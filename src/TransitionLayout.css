       Or keep it small.
       If visual request shows corners, we keep them.
       But "attached" usually implies full edge contact. 
       I will set border-radius to 0 initially or very small.

   Wait, previous code had 60px.
   If cards are rectangular and attached, they look like a film strip.
   If they have corners and are attached, there are diamond gaps.
